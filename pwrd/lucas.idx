            "processing_result": "This is a Bash script named pwrd.sh. It is used to run the powermetrics command and process its output. The script starts by creating a directory called .pwr in the user's home directory if it does not already exist. It also initializes a sequence number file in this directory if it does not exist. The script defines two functions: get_next_sequence, which atomically increments the sequence number, and process_powermetrics, which extracts and saves individual measurements from the powermetrics output. The process_powermetrics function uses tr to remove null bytes from the output, then processes it line by line. When it encounters an XML header, it creates a new file with a timestamp and sequence number, and writes the header to this file. It then appends subsequent lines to this file until it encounters another XML header. The script runs the powermetrics command with the -f plist option to output data in property list format, and the -s option to specify the types of data to collect (cpu_power, gpu_power, ane_power, network, and disk). The -i option specifies an interval of 1000 milliseconds between measurements. The output of the powermetrics command is piped through the process_powermetrics function. This script appears to be related to the parser.py script, as the output of the powermetrics command is in property list format, which can be parsed by the parser.py script."

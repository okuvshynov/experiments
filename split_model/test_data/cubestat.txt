Cubestat is a command-line utility to monitor system metrics in horizon chart format. It was originally created for Apple M1/M2 devices, but now works on Linux with nVidia GPU as well, including Google Colab environment.

Currently cubestat reports:

CPU utilization - configurable per core ('expanded'), cluster of cores: Efficiency/Performance ('cluster') or both. Is shown as percentage.
GPU utilization per card/chip. Is shown in percentage. Works for Apple's M1/M2 SoC and nVidia GPUs. For nVidia GPU shows memory usage as well.
ANE (Apple's Neural Engine) power consumption. According to man powermetrics it is an estimate, but seems working good enough as a proxy to ANE utilization. Is shown as percentage.
Disk and network IO; Is shown in Kb/s.
Memory usage in %

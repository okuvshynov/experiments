cubestat is a command-line utility to monitor system metrics in horizon chart format. It was originally created for Apple M1/M2 devices, but now works on Linux with nVidia GPU as well, including Google Colab environment.

Let's start with example: running deep RL loop on a single MacBook Air M2. We can see model training (on GPU), self-play (done on 4 performance CPU cores) and model evaluation, which runs inference on Neural Engine (ANE): Self-play + training + eval

Currently cubestat reports:

CPU utilization - configurable per core ('expanded'), cluster of cores: Efficiency/Performance ('cluster') or both. Is shown as percentage.
GPU utilization per card/chip. Is shown in percentage. Works for Apple's M1/M2 SoC and nVidia GPUs. For nVidia GPU shows memory usage as well.
ANE (Apple's Neural Engine) power consumption. According to man powermetrics it is an estimate, but seems working good enough as a proxy to ANE utilization. Is shown as percentage.
Disk and network IO; Is shown in Kb/s.
Memory usage in %
Despite many monitoring tools available for monitoring system counters, horizon charts have nice information density properties which make it possible to show a history of N measurements for M metrics on a single screen for significantly large N and M. Thus, this tool was created.
